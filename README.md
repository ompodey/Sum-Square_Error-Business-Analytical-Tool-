# Sum-Square_Error-Business-Analytical-Tool-
Built on python (Mathematical straight fit line coordinates error predictor machine learning foundational model)
# Intro
it is a Machine learning foundational model capable of finding the error in the actual coordinates concerning the provided coordinate dataset and a line.
It runs over the algorithm of straight fit of a line with given advancement of point findings with the use of mathematical calculus.
Henceforth predicts out the final error in the given dataset with graphical representations of the actual amount of errors and final error.
# Scopes
Can be used in cloud computing and furthermore for Stock Market stocks analysis etc.

# Realcase Sinario In Industries:
Let us assume a company wants to figure out its final profit at the end of the year with respect to the assumption profit of the first two months.

Now run the program file (Sum-Square_Error-Business-Analytical-Tool) and enter up the data coordinates of the profits or loss with respect to the months.

Let us define a growth line that was estimated by the company.

Now the Model predicts out the computations of the profit error concerning the growth line and finally explains through graphical representations predicts out that how much was to be the profit for the particular month (uses point prediction algorithm) and how much the actual profit is and finally predicts out the final error in the overall yearly profit.
